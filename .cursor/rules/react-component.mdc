# Cursor Rules

## Whenever you need a React component

1. Carefully consider the component's purpose, functionality, and design

2. Think slowly, step by step, and outline your reasoning

3. Check if a similar component already exists in any of the following locations
   1. packages/ui/src/components
   2. apps/spa/src/components

4. If it doesn't exist, generate a detailed prompt for the component, including:
   - Component name and purpose
   - Desired props and their types
   - Any specific styling or behavior requirements
   - Mention of using Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Request for TypeScript usage

5. URL encode the prompt.

6. Create a clickable link in this format:
   [ComponentName](mdc:https:/v0.dev/chat?q={encoded_prompt})

7. After generating, adapt the component to fit our project structure:
   - Import
     - common shadcn/ui components from <ui_package_alias>@repo/ui/components/ui/</ui_package_alias>
     - app specific components from <app_package_alias>@/components</app_package_alias>
   - Ensure it follows our existing component patterns
   - Add any necessary custom logic or state management
